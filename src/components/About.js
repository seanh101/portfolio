          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi there! I'm Sean Harrington, a software engineer with a background in tech sales and a passion for building innovative solutions. I bring a unique blend of sales expertise and technical acumen, allowing me to bridge the gap between business objectives and cutting-edge technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            With experience in JavaScript, React.js, Python, Django, and more, I have the skills to tackle challenging problems and deliver high-quality code. I thrive on attention to detail, effective communication, and a user-centric mindset to create solutions that meet both technical requirements and user needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my journey as a software engineer, I've worked on several exciting projects. Let me highlight a few of them:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Couch Potato:</strong> Built using the MERN stack, Couch Potato is an application that allows users to search for movies and shows and find out where they are streaming. It features efficient data storage using MongoDB and a seamless user experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Soundify:</strong> Soundify is a playlist and song management web app developed with Django and Python. It offers full CRUD functionality for playlists and songs, authentication and authorization using Django's built-in system, and integration with the Spotify API for song information.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Blackjack:</strong> While not mentioned in the resume, I also worked on a Blackjack game project where I implemented the game logic, user interface, and interactive gameplay using JavaScript. It was an exciting project that showcased my problem-solving and programming skills.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            With a strong foundation in software engineering and a commitment to continuous learning, I'm excited to take on new challenges and contribute to the development of innovative solutions. Connect with me on GitHub (github.com/seanh101) to explore my projects and learn more about my work.
